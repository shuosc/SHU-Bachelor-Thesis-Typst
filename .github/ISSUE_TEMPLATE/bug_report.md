[NOTE]:
If you use a local compiler, you need to provide the typst version information. Typically, if you use VSCode + Tinymist Typst, do the following steps to get the version:

1. Open the command palette (Ctrl + Shift + P).
2. Type "Typst: Tinymist: Show log" and press Enter.
3. Scroll to the top of the log and find `tinymist version information: [..., ["Typst Version", "<version>"], ...]`.
4. Write the version in the table below.

Or if you use the official online compiler at "https://typst.app/", just write "online" in the table below.

| Software     | Version |
